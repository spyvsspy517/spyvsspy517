- 👋 Hi, I’m @spyvsspy517, formerly known as spyvsspy989, but that account is lost.
- 👀 I’m interested in changing the world, world affairs, and life.  Also, stocks, space exploration, and the future of global security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... a lot more than I ever thought I would've been able too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... my own life project, and learn as much as possible along the way.  Any help, would be greatly appreciated.
- 📫 How to reach me ... spyvsspy517@protonmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I'm a male.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... My college roommates and I had a stuffed monkey named Benny.
